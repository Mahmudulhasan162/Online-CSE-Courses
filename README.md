1. Three project features of this project :-

## Features
- Select button shows the individual project name in the cart.
- Total credit hours calculation using React.
- Remaining credit hours calculation using React.


2. How I have managed the state in my assignment project :-

=> I have used useState for those data which can be change over time. I have used useState hook multiple time in the Cards component. 

Firstly, I used it for set courses in the cards. Because the details of the courses keep changing in very card so I used the useState hook so that every card becomes similar in look, different in data.

Secondly, I used it for set selected courses in the cart section. Selected courses can be changed so I used useState hook.

Thirdly, I used the useState for set the calculated total credit hours of the selected courses.

Fourthly, I used the useState for set the remaining credit hours of the selected courses.

Fifthly, I used the useState hook for set the total price of the selected courses.
